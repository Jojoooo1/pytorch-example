Linear Regression: Predicting output
~ y = ax = b

Logistic Regression: Predicting probability => ~ p = [ 0, 1 ]

1. Linear function
2. Logistic function = sigmoide function => transform a linear regression into a probabilistic function
3. SoftMax function => Define classes of probabilities
4. Cross Entropy = Loss function (cost function)
  => A Loss Functions tells us “how good” our model is at making predictions for a given set of parameters
